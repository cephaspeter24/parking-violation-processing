# Parking Violation Processing System

A comprehensive blockchain-based system for managing parking violations, fine collection, and appeals processing for traffic enforcement agencies.

## Overview

The Parking Violation Processing System provides cities and municipalities with a transparent, automated solution for managing parking tickets from issuance through fine collection and appeals. This system leverages blockchain technology to ensure immutability and transparency in parking enforcement operations.

## Real-Life Application

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Clarinet CLI installed
- Node.js and npm
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cephaspeter24/parking-violation-processing.git

## Contract Architecture

The system uses a single comprehensive contract that manages:

- Violation issuance and metadata storage
- Payment processing and fine tracking
- Appeals submission and resolution
- Administrative functions for enforcement officers
- Query functions for public access

## Security Considerations

- Only authorized officers can issue violations
